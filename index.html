I work as a fullstack developer within a SCRUM team. My team is tasked with delivering features for a kuberentes microservices system. The system deploys, coordinates and translates between gaming products of different companies across jurisdictions. To deliver we work with Java/Spring, TypeScript/Angular, GoCD/Ansible and script bash. Our data processing is handled via Google Cloud (Pub-Sub/Apache Beam/Big Query). We employ TDD and CI in our everyday work.
In my spare time I enjoy writing a bit of Haskell, Idris or Purescript, be it useful script, a coding exercise or an open source contribution.</p><h2>Technical Profile</h2><ul><li>Fundamentals of category theory functional programming (Haskell, vavr.io for Java, fantasy-land spec for JS)</li><li>Experience with reactive programming (Behaviour, RxJS, WebFlux)</li><li>Experience with big data streaming and processing in google cloud (Pub-Sub, Apache Beam, BigQuery)</li><li>Enterprise level Java and TypeScript experience</li><li>Experience with frontend languages and frameworks (JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Redux, RxJS)</li><li>Basics of Linux terminal usage and shell scripting</li><li>Continuous Integration (GoCD, SonarQube, Ansible)</li><li>TDD (Jasmine, JUnit, HUnit)</li><li>BDD (Mocha/Chai with Cucumber.js/gherkin)</li><li>Property testing (vavr.io, QuickCheck)</li></ul><h2>Soft skills</h2><ul><li>Agile (SCRUM, cooperating with stakeholders to get things done)</li><li>Public speaking (teaching devs and philosophy undergraduates, presenting, leading workshops)</li></ul><h2>Career History</h2><h3>Gamesys Limited</h3><p>January 2017 - Present
