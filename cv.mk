## Personal summary

I am a polyglot programmer with a background in philosophy of media and computing.
My experience ranges from writing AngularJS/Cordova mobile aps for my own startup, through cooperating on large Angular/TypeScript/Redux projects to using Ansible scripts to ship Dataflows to Google cloud. 
Currently, when not concerned with Apache Beam/Big Query stories, I lead internal TypeScript/Functional Programming workshops or fill in a release.

In my spare time I love learning new languages, experimenting with frontend stacks and participating in JavaScript game jams.

On my github you might find experiments with technologies such as Clojure/ClojureScript/DataScript, React/Redux/Immutable.js and Haskell.

## Technical Profile

* TDD (Jasmine, JUnit, HUnit)
* BDD (Mocha/Chai with Cucumber.js/gherkin)
* Property Testing (vavr.io, QuickCheck)
* Reactive Functional Programming (RxJava, RxJs)
* Category Theory Functional Programming (Haskell, vavr.io for Java, fantasy-land spec for JS)
* Big data streaming (Apache Beam)
* CSS frameworks and preprocessors (Bootstrap, Jeet, Axis, SCSS, Less, Stylus)
* Frontend languages and frameworks (JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, React)
* Frontend build systems (webapack, angular cli, fuse-box)
* Frontend linting (JSLint, TSLint, ESLint)

## Soft skills

* Agile (SCRUM, cooperating with stakeholders to get stuff done)
* Public speaking (teaching devs and philosophy undergraduates, presenting, leading workshops)
* Reading (as a former philosopher, I can read like a pro)
