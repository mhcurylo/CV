## Personal summary


I am a polyglot programmer with a background in the philosophy of media and computing.
I work as a fullstack developer within a SCRUM team. My team is tasked with delivering features for a kuberentes microservices system. The system deploys, coordinates and translates between gaming products of different companies across jurisdictions. To deliver we work with Java/Spring, TypeScript/Angular, GoCD/Ansible and script bash. Our data processing is handled via Google Cloud (Pub-Sub/Apache Beam/Big Query). We employ TDD and CI in our everyday work.
In my spare time I enjoy writing a bit of Haskell, Idris or Purescript, be it useful script, a coding exercise or an open source contribution.


## Technical Profile


* Fundamentals of category theory functional programming (Haskell, vavr.io for Java, fantasy-land spec for JS)
* Experience with reactive programming (Behaviour, RxJS, WebFlux)
* Experience with big data streaming and processing in google cloud (Pub-Sub, Apache Beam, BigQuery)
* Enterprise level Java and TypeScript experience
* Experience with frontend languages and frameworks (JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Redux, RxJS)
* Basics of Linux terminal usage and shell scripting
* Continuous Integration (GoCD, SonarQube, Ansible)
* TDD (Jasmine, JUnit, HUnit)
* BDD (Mocha/Chai with Cucumber.js/gherkin)
* Property testing (vavr.io, QuickCheck)


## Soft skills


* Agile (SCRUM, cooperating with stakeholders to get things done)
* Public speaking (teaching devs and philosophy undergraduates, presenting, leading workshops)
